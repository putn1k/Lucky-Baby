              <div class="blog-article__content">
                <p>Amber is a fossilized tree resin, commonly used to make beads that are worn as necklaces or bracelets by teething babies. It is believed that when amber beads come into contact with the baby's skin, they release a substance called succinic acid, which is said to have analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties that provide relief to teething babies. However, it's important to note that these claims are largely anecdotal, and scientific evidence supporting these benefits is limited.</p>
